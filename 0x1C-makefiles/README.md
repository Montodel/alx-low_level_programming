# C - Makefiles

Topics aim was to understand what makefiles are, how, why and when they should be used. Also topic helped in understanding:-
* What are rules and how to set and use them
* What are explicit and implicit rules
* What are the most common / useful rules
* What are variables and how to set and use them

Following task files helped in testing my understanding on the concept. Files used for the tasks were [main.c](../0x1C-makefiles/main.c) and [school.c](../0x1C-makefiles/school.c) for tests while creating makefiles

[0-Makefile](../0x1C-makefiles/0-Makefile)

Creates Makefile with the follwing requirements

* name of the executable: `holberton`
* rules: `all`
* The `all` rule builds your executable
* variables: none

[1-Makefile](../0x1C-makefiles/1-Makefile)

Make file with the following requirements

* name of the executable: `holberton`
* rules: `all`
* The `all` rule builds your executable
* variables: `CC`, `SRC`
* `CC`: the compiler to be used
* `SRC`: the .c files

[2-Makefile](../0x1C-makefiles/2-Makefile)

Make file with the following requirements

name of the executable: `holberton`

rules: `all`

The all rule builds your executable

variables: `CC`, `SRC`, `OBJ`, `NAME`

`CC`: the compiler to be used
`SRC`: the `.c` files
`OBJ`: the `.o` files
`NAME`: the name of the executable
The `all` rule should recompile only the updated source files
Not allowed to have a list of all the `.o` files

[3-Makefile](../0x1C-makefiles/3-Makefile)

Make file that meets the following requirements

name of the executable: `holberton`

rules: `all`, `clean`, `oclean`, `fclean`, `re`

`all`: builds your executable
`clean`: deletes all Emacs and Vim temporary files along with the executable
`oclean`: deletes the object files
`fclean`: deletes all Emacs and Vim temporary files, the executable, and the object files
`re`: forces recompilation of all source files

variables: `CC`, `SRC`, `OBJ`, `NAME`, `RM`

`CC`: the compiler to be used
`SRC`: the `.c` files
`OBJ`: the `.o` files
`NAME`: the name of the executable
`RM`: the program to delete files
The all rule should recompile only the updated source files
The `clean`, `oclean`, `fclean`, `re` rules should never fail
Not allowed to have a list of all the `.o` files

[4-Makefile](../0x1C-makefiles/4-Makefile)

Make file that meets [3-Makefile](../0x1C-makefiles/3-Makefile) makefile requirements but with following additional requirement

Variable

* `CFLAGS`: your favorite compiler flags: `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic`

[5-island_perimeter.py](../0x1C-makefiles/5-island_perimeter.py)

Function `def island_perimeter(grid):` that returns the perimeter of the island described in `grid`

`grid` is a list of list of integers

* 0 represents a water zone
* 1 represents a land zone
* One cell is a square with side length 1
* Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally).
* Grid is rectangular, width and height don’t exceed 100
* Grid is completely surrounded by water, and there is one island (or nothing).
* The island doesn’t have “lakes” (water inside that isn’t connected to the water around the island).

example of grid is as follows

```.py

grid = [
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    ]

```

Perimeter of ground covered by land is got by visiting every cell in the grid and determining soroundings ie. on it's top, bottom, left, right to check if theres water or land on the sides. Each side that has water on sides gets 1 unit addition to it's parameter. We keep on adding the sides that have water as neighbours and also taking into consideration first indexes and last grid indexes until the end of whole grid
